# Extension for FHEM-docker installation to communicate with Signal

Files to build a docker image with Signal support via Signalbot (Integration for signal messenger) and signal-cli (https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli). At the moment it only tested on a Rapberrypi (ARM). On x86 architure use Dockerfile.x86 .

The original fhem/fhem-docker image is used, see the documentation at https://github.com/fhem/fhem-docker/ . 

## Usage

* clone files 
* cd into this directory
* run `docker-compose up -d`
* go to http://`your hostname`:8083
* define a new entity with  `define signal Signalbot`
